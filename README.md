# Grind n Slime

An app that gamifies habit-forming and task management by motivating the user with a slime friend who fights enemies. Finishing (checking off the boxes) tasks such as "Walk for 10min" or "Drink water", the player is rewarded with coins that can be spent in the shop for accessories and weapons. 

Grind n' Slime was built using React, Node.js, and the gameplay was created using the Godot game engine.
